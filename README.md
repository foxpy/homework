# homework

This is a university programming homework. Initially I thought publishing all
the wonderful programming stuff here. Maybe I would have been sending E-mails
with links to tasks here to my lecturers. Ha-ha. This repository turned out to
become a complete dumpster of low quality code which was accepted by all my
lecturers somehow. If you have found it - enjoy.
