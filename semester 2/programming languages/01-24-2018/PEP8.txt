PEP8


============
Introduction

Python developers left us a guide which should be followed when writing programs
in Python. The guide could be found here:
	https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/



============
Main of PEP8

First thing to know about Python is an indentation style. Using 4 spaces per
level is recommended. Avoid tabs. Python 3 disallows mixing the use of tabs and
spaces for indentation!

Also there is a line length limit of 79 characters. I find this part ridiculous
and use 120 characters per line limit in my projects but still try to follow
PEP8 in Python code. Meh.

PEP8 contains a useful information on binary operators position. There are two
common styles: leaving operator at the end of the string or putting it at the
beginning. PEP8 allows using both of them. I prefer second, like:

sum_of_values = (value1
		+ value2
		+ value3)

It is nice to leave two blank lines between classes and one between methods.

For encoding it is better to use ASCII or UTF-8. If you use something else:
1) type `# -*- coding: your-encoding-here -*-` at the beginning of the file
(under shebang if exists).
2) kill yourself.

Imports are placed at separate lines, like:

import magic
import shine

Imports location is always at the top of the file under shebang or encoding (if
exist).

There is no difference between single and double quotes: use whatever you like.

Comments should be complete sentences. AVOID non-English comments.
Inline comments should be indent by at least of two spaces from master line.

This is not fobidden to use unix_hacker_snake_case naming style so I use it.

However, modules should have suchnaming.
